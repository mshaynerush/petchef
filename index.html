                                <p>
                                        The Pet Chef Delivered story began better than 3 years ago with our puppy.  He is the sweetest thing; with the longest list of food allergies, you could imagine. 
                                        Four pages of them, in fact.  So many, there was not a single dog food on the market he could eat without triggering a reaction.  It was scary and overwhelming to 
                                        think that there was not a single dog food he could eat.   
                                </p>
                                <p><br></p>
                                <p>
                                        It took a serious commitment, but after countless hours of research into dog nutrition, analysis of his allergy test results and recipe testing and development we 
                                        can finally rest easily and feed our guy a menu we know is good for his health.  We have a handle on how to determine the foods a pet might be allergic to.  We know 
                                        how to write a nutritious recipe that accounts for all nutrients a pet needs.  We have refined a cooking process that allows for each batch to be developed without 
                                        fear of cross contamination with allergic ingredients.
